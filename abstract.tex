With the deployment of a computer controlled railway transport, systems were
created that allowed the central control computer to interact with external
elements of railway safety systems – switches, signals, etc. This thesis
focuses on the design and implementation of a bus that allows such interaction,
but on model railways. The thesis proposes and implements a new protocol of
a bus for controlling model railway – MTBbus. It is described why the current
railroad management system is insufficient, requirements for a new system are
formulated, this system is implemented. Within the thesis, a detailed design of a
new protocol, new hardware modules for railway control, a module for
communication with a computer, software and a library integrating the new
hardware with the current railway control software were created. The new
control system was tested and deployed on real model railroads, thus enabling
their further expansion and commissioning of new ways of traffic management. An
open and robust system with a view to long-term sustainability was created. The
system surpasses many current commercial model railroad control systems, it is
general, so it can be used in many other applications.
