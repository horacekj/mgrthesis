The modern computer-controlled railway relies on robust hardware and
buses that allow the central computer to interact with external elements of
railway safety systems such as switches or signals. This thesis presents MTBbus
- a new bus and protocol that allows similar functionality for model railways.
First, we give an in-depth overview of the existing, insufficient solutions.
Then we present the design of a new protocol, the new corresponding hardware
modules for railway control, and the hardware module for computer control. We
provide a software solution that integrates the new hardware and bus with
existing railway-control software. We have successfully tested and deployed
the presented system on several real model railroads. The upgrade of the
railroad to our system allows them to extend their functionality in new traffic
management methods. Our solution is open and also has proven to be robust with
the potential for long-term sustainability. MTBbus surpasses many
state-of-the-art commercial systems. It is also applicable outside the model
railways context.
